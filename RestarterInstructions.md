Restarter Instructions

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The restarter is an add-on to the MCForge program and is used in maintaining a clean restart for the program with possible problems.

Make sure when you "Build Solution" for MCForge. Go into the bin/release directory and add the Restarter.exe and Restarter.pdb which are found in the main directory.

Then, run the MCForge.exe and the restart will run smoothly :)
